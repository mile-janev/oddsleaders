	<a href="" class="button grey">2. When I try to place a bet, I get a message that I have exceeded the winning limit. How high is the winning limit?</a>
	<div class="answer">
		For our earnings limits, please see our Betting - Standards.<br><br>
		Our bookmakers are also entitled to set lower winning limits per bet. You will be informed of this directly when you place your bet.<br><br>
		There may be various reasons for changing a winning limit, depending on the supply and demand for a bet. Please note that winning limits may also be lowered at short notice when our bookmakers update the odds. It is usually possible to place the same bet with higher stakes shortly thereafter. In the meantime, however, the odds may also have changed.

	<a href="" class="button grey">3. How high is the minimum and maximum bet on a bet?</a>
	<div class="answer">
		The maximum stake on a bet is calculated from the above-mentioned winning limit. If upon placing a bet you receive the message that your current stake exceeds this limit, please reduce your stake. The minimum stake for a bet is EUR 0.50; USD 0.50; Â£ 0.50.

If your account balance is below this amount, you also have the option of placing smaller bets.
