any dispute or to improve customer services.

<h2>22. GOVERNING LAW</h2>

These Agreements shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Macedonia. You 

irrevocably agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Macedonia for settlement of 

any disputes or matters arising out of or concerning these Agreements or their enforceability. If any part

<h2>23. ASSIGNMENT</h2>

<h2>24. SPORTS BETTING SERVICES</h2>

<h3>24.1</h3>

The following terms apply only to Your use of the Sports betting Services. Please note that in the event of any conflict between this Section 24 and the remaining Sections of these Terms and Conditions, this Section 24 shall prevail to the extent that it applies to Your use of the Sports betting Services.

<h3>24.2. Rules and Procedures of the Sports betting Services</h3>

You must use the Sports betting Services in accordance with the generally accepted games rules set out in Our Sports betting Services Rules and any other page that specifically relates to and governs any particular event, game or tournament ('Rules'). We advise You to read all of these Rules carefully.

<h3>24.3. Betting Terms</h3>

We reserve the right to use symbols (such as 1,X,2) and abbreviations for the indication of betting outcomes. We will at any time maintain a Help section on the Sports betting Services providing information about the betting types and terms used. We advise You to familiarise Yourself with the exact details of any bet before placing it. Any additional information detailed at the top or bottom of events and odds displays forms part of the betting rules for the particular event and in the event of any disparity, shall take precedence over these terms. We advise You to read all of this information carefully.

<h3>24.3.1 Limits on Stakes</h3>

We reserve the right to limit the maximum amount wagered for each single or multiple bet.

<h3>24.3.2 Limits on Winnings</h3>

The maximum aggregate amount that You may win via the Sports betting Services is 100 000 euro, the minimum amount for stake is 1 euro.

<h3>24.3.3 Calculation of winnings</h3>

In the case of a fixed odds bet, winnings are calculated by multiplying the stake by the fixed odds. In the case of live bets, You accept any changes in odds during the bet placement process. Changes in odds are understood to be those which change between the pick being added to the bet slip and Our acceptance of the bet. The odds are then displayed in Your bet confirmation notification. In the event that You make more than one bet (including the combination of single and multi bets) and Your total winnings exceed the limits on winnings set out in 24.3.2 above, We shall be entitled to reduce the state to the extent that it is necessary to comply with the limits on winnings.

<h3>24.3.4 Accuracy of Bets and Results</h3>

In order to ensure the highest accuracy of all bets and results, we calculate Your Account funds using four decimal points. For technical reasons, Your Account balance can only be displayed to two decimal points, which may from time to time lead to discrepancies when a value with four decimal points is rounded off to a value with two decimal points.

<h3>24.4 Acceptance and Validation of Terms</h3>

<h3>24.4.1</h3>

Bets must be made via the Sports betting Services.

<h3>24.4.2</h3>

A bet is deemed to be valid following confirmation of acceptance from Our remote servers. A bet is confirmed when it appears in the customer’s account under "My Bets". When a bet is placed and accepted, the corresponding amount is charged against Your Account. Once accepted, bets cannot be cancelled or amended in any way.

<h3>24.4.3</h3>

When placing the bet, You confirm that You do not have any previous knowledge of the result of the respective event underlying the bet ('Event'). If, during the period of acceptance of bets, information becomes known through which the outcome of an Event can be determined, We reserve the right to vary the deadline for acceptance of bets or to void any bets placed.

<h3>24.4.4</h3>

We reserve the right to void any bet, including but not limited to any bet which may be inadvertently accepted when Your Account does not have sufficient funds to cover the amount of the bet placed prior to the Event taking place. Subject to the foregoing, if Your Account balance partly covers a stake for a bet, We reserve the right to accept Your bet with a stake equal to the sum of Your Account balance. We also reserve the right to take any measures necessary to protect You from further losses should you lose EUR 5,000 (or its equivalent) or more in any four-week period.

<h3>24.4.5</h3>

All bets must be made and accepted before the start of the relevant Event. Any bet placed or received after the start of the Event will be void unless the betting offer is clearly intended to be available after the start of the Event (i.e. live betting, outrights).

<h3>24.4.6</h3>

If, in the case of live betting, delayed TV coverage or data transmission results in a bet being placed at the incorrect price immediately after the selected participant/team has gained a significant advantage, We reserve the right to void the bet, win or lose.

<h3>24.4.7</h3>

If an Event is cancelled and deemed void, the respective selection is considered with neutral decimal odds of one (1.00). In the event of an individual bet, the amount of the bet is refunded. In the case of multiple bets in which Events cancelled appear together with other valid events with a winning forecast, the multiple bet is considered won but the accumulated odds are adjusted accordingly.

<h3>24.4.8</h3>

Multiple bets are not accepted where the outcome of one part of the bet contributes to the outcome of another.

<h3>24.4.9</h3>

We reserve the right to refuse in whole or in part any bet and all ambiguous bets shall be void.

<h3>24.4.10</h3>

We reserve the right to suspend, modify, remove and/or add any Sports Service at its absolute discretion with immediate effect and without notice and it will not be liable for any such action.

<h3>24.5 Account Currency Changes</h3>

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that You change Your Account Currency during the life of a bet, any winnings will be converted into Your new Account Currency at the Exchange Rates at time of payout.

<h3>24.6 Early Payout</h3>

We may offer an ‘Early Payout’ only for live bets. You will have the option to accept settlement of bets 
You have placed before the result of the bet is determined. The ‘Early Payout’ amount is calculated 
based on the current run of play and is subject to change depending on when you chose to accept 
an ‘Early Payout’. If an ‘Early Payout’ is available for a bet, the corresponding symbol will be displayed in 
the ‘My bets’ section of the bet slip.<br>
The ‘Early Payout’ functionality is only available for single bets. Multi and System bets are excluded from 
the ‘Early Payout’ function. Any ‘Early Payout’ selection will not count towards wagering restrictions if 
bonuses are used to place the bet.
Where any bet is frozen or closed or the ‘Early Payout’ value has changed during play, the ‘Early Payout’ 
may be rejected.<br><br>
If an ‘Early Payout’ is accepted by Us when the result of that bet has already been determined, We reserve the right to void the ‘Early Payout’. We also reserve the right to void and reclaim any ‘Early Payout’ where we believe You have abused the ‘Early Payout’ feature.

or system ('Shared Game/Table Platform') which enables Gaming Service users to play with players 

coming into the games, tables and tournaments from other websites and brands operating on the same 

Shared Game/Table Platform. If a Shared Game/Table Platform is used, You agree that You may be 

pooled into these common game/tables, at Our sole discretion, and that to the extent that You breach

circumstances in which such activity occurred.
